*****Poblem From Learn To Program by Chris Pine - My Soution*****

Write a program that asks for a starting year and an
ending year and then puts all the leap years between them (and
including them, if they are also leap years). Leap years are years
divisible by 4 (like 1984 and 2004). However, years divisible by
100 are not leap years (such as 1800 and 1900) unless they are
also divisible by 400 (such as 1600 and 2000, which were in fact
leap years). What a mess
